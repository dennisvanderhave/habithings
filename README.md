## Introduction

The HabiThings project aims at providing a universal integration platform for all things around the automation of your personal habitat. Let's bring online automated tasks, home automation and the internet of things together to make your personal habitat more comfortable.

It is written in NodeJS, to make sure you can run it on your favorite operating system / device (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc).

It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic by bringing together different bus systems, hardware devices and interface protocols. 

This is a first step for the HabiThings project and there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. So please check out the roadmap to see where the project is headed or participate by contributing along the way.

# Contribute

There are many of ways to contribute to the project.

You can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features as they are implemented, submit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submit code fixes or code contributions of your own.

Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.
