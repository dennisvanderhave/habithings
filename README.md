## Introduction

The HabiThings project aims at connecting and automating all the things in your personal habitat, to make your life easier and more comfortable.
With "things", we mean anything that can be automated: switching electrical devices at home, responding to your location, managing your social media and other online services. HabiThings will be your one simple solution for making your personal habitat a lot more comfortable.

Currently there are a lot of different automation systems on the market and none of them provide an affordable and complete solution. For example: there are systems that are restricted to a single type of product (Philips Hue / KlikAanKlikUit), systems that only talk a single "language" (Zigbee / Z-Wave / X10) and systems that try to integrate them but are very closed and hard to manage.

Life will not get easier if you have to switch between many different remotes to control them all. Or even if you managed to get them working all together with a single remote, you've probably ended up with an expensive and very difficult to manage system. HabiThings will be the single and flexible remote that controls all your "things" and hides the difficult and technical stuff from you (because you don't want to be bothered with that).

HabiThings is free and open source. Anyone with an internet connection can download, install and get it up and running without spending a dime. It is designed to be absolutely vendor-neutral as well as hardware/protocol-agnostic by bringing together different bus systems, hardware devices and interface protocols. It is written in NodeJS, to make sure you can run it on your favorite operating system / device (Windows, Mac OSX, Linux, Raspberry Pi, etc). On top of that, anyone can develop new plug-ins to expand the functionality of the system and increase the support of devices/services.

## Contribute

There are many of ways to contribute to the project.

### Code

You can contribute by reviewing and sending feedback on code checkins, suggesting and trying out new features as they are implemented, submit bugs and help us verify fixes as they are checked in, as well as submit code fixes or code contributions of your own.

Note that all code submissions will be rigorously reviewed and tested by the team, and only those that meet an extremely high bar for both quality and design/roadmap appropriateness will be merged into the source.

### Documentation

If you are not a developer, another way you can contribute is to add and/or update the documentation. The wiki is in the startup phase, but the plan is to write a lot of good documentation, so anyone can get started using and developing for the system.

### Hardware

If there is some hardware that you would like to see HabiThings support, but you are not able to create a plugin for it yourself, please contact a developer so they can create a plugin for it. 

## Roadmap

This is a first step for the HabiThings project and there is still a lot of work that needs to be done. So please check out the roadmap to see where the project is headed or participate by contributing along the way.

This project is still in its infancy, but is being developed at a feverish pace and there are many exciting things on the horizon. Be sure to check back soon for more information on this exciting project.
